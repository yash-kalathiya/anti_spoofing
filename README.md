# Face Detection and Anti-Spoofing Project

Welcome to the Face Detection and Anti-Spoofing project, where we utilize Python libraries and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to enhance security measures and ensure authenticity in facial recognition systems.

## Features

1. **Face Detection**: Utilizes advanced Python libraries for accurate face detection, laying the foundation for robust facial recognition.

2. **Anti-Spoofing**: Implements CNN networks to fortify the system against spoofing attacks, ensuring only genuine interactions are recognized and authenticated.
